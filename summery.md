# summarise

I will have to present an scrolly telling oral presentation of my research to my fellow students and would like to inform them in a brief under 10 minute overview of what scrolly telling is and the tech that can be used to leverage it into your projects possible advantages and any other information that might be of interest to future front end web developers. My example website is currently [https://jraymondt.com/scroll-out/](https://jraymondt.com/scroll-out/) and is HTML/CSS/JS I would like to incorporate my presentation into a scrolly telling website at the same address, using more or less using the same approach and code, but also add a stary backgroud effect to give some depth.

Please create a script I can use that will not go over 10 minutes an allows for a question at the end.

Other requirements of my presentation include:

- Functional requirements of Scrolly Telling - What it is required implement and how it functions. 
- How a user would use it.
- Languages being used and its implications for Client and Server-side requirements including session management, authentication and web security if needed.
- Recommendations for use in our client's virtual hotel facade website, I am leaning towards making 
- Any foreseeable problems that may occur with implementation / integration with a client's website and recommendations on how to overcome these.
- If web technology is of a particular type that has more than one implementation discuss why you have chosen that technology instead of any of the others.

If it seems to go over 10 minutes that is ok, I will condense it when I present it, just provide enough information so that I can get familiar with the tech and be able to explain it in a natural way.

### Presenting findings to the class:

![vidja]()

#### other BS

Please provide a supporting document (Word or InDesign) which outlines how the following
concepts have been used in your new technology.

- outline the principles of the internet and the technologies that underpin its existence summarise the key principles of analysis and design
- outline programming control structures and object-oriented programming 
- explain web programming concepts, including:
    1. the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)
    2. stateless programming
    3. session management
    4. authentication and web security
    5. client-side programming

- explain the latest web technology trends, and their application, to a client evaluate a web application, using trends in web technology
- identify the sources of information regarding new and emerging, trends and technologies during your research, explain any new and innovative ideas (if any) you have found to improve work practices and processes

## Complete the task by following these steps:

1. Research the internet, library database, organisation, or other source for an emerging web technology
2. Choose a technology
3. Discuss and confirm selection (technology) with required personnel (Lecturer).
3. Complete a presentation using software such as PowerPoint
4. Present to peers
5. Complete research paper from note
